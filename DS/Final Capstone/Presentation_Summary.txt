Self learning allowed me to get exposed to machine learning, even before joining Thinkful, but never learned about time-series stuff, thinking they were very hard.  According to my small research, there is a skill gap in the area. Also, I was contacted by recruiters wanting someone to work on their time-series data sets. Forecasting the future is interesting. Thus, I decided to overcome my fear and explore time-series analysis. Predicting inventory demand, sales, cryptocurrency, stock price are either overdone, hard to predict, or not interesting. 
Originally, I wanted to work on Uber/Lyft data set but couldn't find recent data set but found a similar data set from NYC Open Data.  Yellow taxis are still popular in New York city even though Uber is affecting their market share. Still, there is huge amount of investment in yellow taxis. Therefore, I wanted to increase their profit by making a model that can predict demand at different locations of New York city. One of the complaints customers have about yellow taxis is unavailability. There are only 13000 yellow taxis but vehicles affiliated with Uber are more than 65000. My model cannot beat Uber for sure, but it can improve service and profit for Yellow taxis. 

The total fares collected from all drivers at a location in Manhattan is in the thousands order. My model forecasts the total fare that could be earned at different pickup locations. If more fare can be earned, it indicates high demand and more profit for drivers. The root mean squared error for the best model is $101. 
I believe the experience from predicting yellow taxi demand is transferable to Uber or  other businesses which generate time-series data.
