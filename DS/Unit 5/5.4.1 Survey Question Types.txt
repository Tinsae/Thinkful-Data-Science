DRILL: Question Design
For each of the following, indicate the best question type to use and why.

Age
It can be free response. If the study cares about age groups it can be multiple choice type
A. <18  B. [18, 26]  C. [26, 35]  D. >35 

Gender
I often see drop-down boxes. Bisexual, Transgender are included. 


Income
If the study wants ranges, multiple choice is good
