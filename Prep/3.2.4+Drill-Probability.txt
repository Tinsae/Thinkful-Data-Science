Q1. Calculate the probability of flipping a balanced coin four times and getting each pattern: 
HTTH, HHHH, TTHH

Heads and tails are equally likely: 50% or 0.5
Getting heads or tails in one experiment does not affect the result of other experiments

P(HTTH) = 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/ 16
P(HHHH) = 1/16
P(TTHH) = 1/16 

Q2. If a list of people has 24 women and 21 men, 
then the probability of choosing a man from the list is 21/45. 
What is the probability of not choosing a man?

Not choosing a man is the same as choosing a women

P(Not choosing a man) = 1 - 21/45 = 1 - 7/15 = 8/15

P(Choosing a women) = 24/ (24 + 21) = 24/45 = 8/15

Q3. The probability that Bernice will travel by plane sometime in the next year is 10%. 
The probability of a plane crash at any time is .005%. 
What is the probability that Bernice will be in a plane crash sometime in the next year? 

Let T = Bernice will travel by plane sometime in the next year
Let C = Plane crash some time in the next year

P(T) = 0.1
P(C/T) = 0.005

P(T and C) = P(T) * P(C/T) = 0.1 * 0.005 = 0.0005

Q4. A data scientist wants to study the behavior of users on the company website. 
Each time a user clicks on a link on the website, there is a 5% chance that the user
 will be asked to complete a short survey about their behavior on the website. 
The data scientist uses the survey data to conclude that, on average, users 
spend 15 minutes surfing the company website before moving on to other things. 
What is wrong with this conclusion?

The survey result doesn't represent all users of the company website, the experiement 
has a selection bias. Those users who browse longer are likely to click many links
which increases their chance of participating in the survey
