A diagnostic test has a 98% probability of giving a positive result 
when applied to a person suffering from Thripshaw's Disease, 
and 10% probability of giving a (false) positive when applied to a non-sufferer. 
It is estimated that 0.5 % of the population are sufferers.
Suppose that the test is now administered to a person
whose disease status is unknown. 

D => a person suffers from the disease
+ve => positive result

P(test will be positive) ?

P(+ve) = P(D) * P(+ve/D) + P(¬D) * P(+ve/¬D) 
       = 0.005 * 0.98 + 0.995 * 0.10
       = 0.1044

P(test will correctly diagnose a sufferer of Thripshaw's)

P(+ve/D) = 0.98

P(test will correctly identify a non-sufferer of Thripshaw's

P(¬+ve/¬D) = 1 - P(+ve/¬D) = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90

P(test will misclassify the person)

This can happen in either of the two ways
* A person has a disease and test shows negative
* A person don't have the disease and test shows positive

P(¬D) * P(+ve/¬D) + P(D) * P(¬+ve/D) = 0.995 * 0.10 + 0.005 * 0.02 = 0.0996
