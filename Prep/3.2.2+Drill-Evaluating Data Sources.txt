Data Source: Amsterdam availability data scraped from AirBnB on December 24th. 
Question: What are the popular neighborhoods in Amsterdam?

I see two biases
* Not all houses in Amsterdam are registered on AirBnb
* Dec 24 is holiday period therefore many houses may not be available for lodging, lease or rent

Hence, we cannot conclude anything about populairty of neighbourhoods

=> "which homes are popular on holidays"

Data Source: Mental health services use on September 12, 2001 
in San Francisco, CA and New York City, NY. 
Question: How do patterns of mental health service use vary between cities?

* The data was obtained after an exceptional circumstance, 9/11 attacks
* It will be more accurate if more cities are included

=> "Mental health servies variation between a city near a crisis and farther ones"
